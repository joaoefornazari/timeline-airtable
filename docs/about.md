# Prototyping

The primary structure that I projected to the Timeline app is as the following image displays:

![image](./assets/timeline_prototype.drawio.png)

Each rectangle refers to a component:

- Red/Salmon - `timeline-container`, which will be our `App` component.
- Green - `action-header`
- Dark Blue - `timeline-content`
- Yellow - `dates-header`
- Cyan - `date`
- Black - `events-container`
- Purple - `event`

The purple rectangles are there also to demonstrate possible renderings of the event badges.
